# Machine-Learning-Project
Comprehensive Retail Demand Forecasting ML Project

This project aims to develop an intelligent system for predicting retail demand, enabling better inventory management and sales planning. The core of the project is a machine learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset encompassing various aspects of retail operations and external influences.

The Jupyter Notebook (Demand forecasting ML project .ipynb) walks through the entire machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading & Initial Exploration: Begins by loading the retail_store_inventory.csv dataset and performing initial checks (e.g., handling missing values, descriptive statistics).
Feature Engineering & Preprocessing: Categorical features like 'Store Location', 'Product Category', 'Region', 'Weather Condition', and 'Seasonality' are transformed using Label Encoding to make them suitable for model training. Irrelevant columns are dropped.
Model Training (Random Forest Regressor): A RandomForestRegressor is chosen for its robustness and ability to capture complex relationships within the data. The model is trained on a split of the prepared dataset.
Performance Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated using the R-squared metric, and predictions are visualized against actual demand to assess fit.
Feature Importance Analysis: The project identifies and visualizes the most influential features contributing to demand fluctuations, providing actionable insights.
Interactive Prediction Interface (Gradio): For practical application, an interactive Gradio application is integrated. This interface allows users to input various product and store parameters and instantly receive a demand forecast, making the model easily accessible and demonstrable.
This project serves as a robust framework for businesses looking to optimize their inventory and supply chain based on data-driven demand predictions.

New Section to Add:
